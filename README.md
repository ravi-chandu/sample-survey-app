### Step 2
We have to save this excel sheet in OneDrive to connect the Power App – to update Automatically 

### Step 3
Create Canvas app
For this we can do in different ways

-	Choosing create Canvas app then add data to the app or
- Choose the data source then creating the app

In my opinion Choosing the data source first then creating app is bit easy.

### Step 4
Now the app is created with some of our data
We need to modify the app as per requirements 
 
After modifying the app, we have to save and share the app with Specifying the permission (co-owners / users)
